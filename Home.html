    <h1>What I Offer</h1>
    <p>I believe I bring a refreshing sense of enthusiasm in being a part of a team. 
        I pride myself in bringing strong energy to the people I work closest with. For me, that may look like coffee chats before working on ML pipelines, or being the overly energetic player on the bench of my schoolâ€™s basketball team. I am confident in my ability to find and adapt to my surroundings, ensuring I provide maximum value and enjoyment. This adaptability has proven invaluable in technical environments where collaboration drives innovation. Whether I'm debugging code with teammates at 2 AM or presenting complex algorithmic solutions to diverse stakeholders, I bring the same genuine enthusiasm that helps turn challenging problems into shared victories. I'm excited to channel this energy into industry, where I can contribute not just technical skills, 
        but also the kind of positive momentum that elevates entire teams and drives breakthrough results.</p>
